To get the sum of even numbers of Fibonacci series less than four million, following algorithm is followed:

1. Firstly Fibonacci series is continuously generated by allocating the first and second element of series as 1 and summing previous two terms to get the next number in series.
2. Each element is checked if it is even or not and element is summed if the element is even.
3. Next number in series is calculated and continued till it is equal to or greater than 4 million.

Above algorithm is used in the program attached in repo.
